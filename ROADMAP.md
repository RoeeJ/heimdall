# Heimdall DNS Server Roadmap

## Current Status: Phase 2 Complete! üéâ

**‚úÖ PRODUCTION-READY DNS SERVER**: Heimdall is now a high-performance DNS server!
- Successfully resolves all common DNS record types (A, AAAA, MX, NS, CNAME, TXT, SOA)
- Dual protocol support (UDP + TCP) with automatic fallback
- Intelligent caching with sub-millisecond response times
- Complete DNS compression pointer handling
- Full EDNS0 support with buffer size negotiation and extension parsing
