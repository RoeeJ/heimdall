# Heimdall DNS Server Roadmap

## Current Status: Phase 1 Complete! üéâ

**‚úÖ WORKING DNS SERVER**: Heimdall is now a fully functional DNS resolver!
- Successfully resolves A, AAAA, MX, NS, CNAME, TXT, and SOA records
- Configurable upstream servers with automatic fallback
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Environment-based configuration
- Production-ready for basic DNS forwarding

**Usage**: `cargo run` - Server listens on 127.0.0.1:1053
**Test**: `dig @127.0.0.1 -p 1053 google.com A`

## Vision
Transform Heimdall into a high-performance, adblocking DNS server with custom domain management capabilities, suitable for home labs and small networks.

## Phase 1: Core DNS Functionality (Foundation) ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
**Goal**: Implement a fully functional DNS resolver

### 1.1 Basic Resolution ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
- [‚úÖ] Implement upstream DNS query forwarding
- [‚úÖ] Add configurable upstream DNS servers (Cloudflare 1.1.1.1, Google 8.8.8.8/8.8.4.4)
- [‚úÖ] Support for multiple upstream servers with fallback
- [‚úÖ] Implement proper DNS response generation
- [‚úÖ] Fix the `valid()` method to properly validate packets
- [‚úÖ] Add comprehensive error handling

### 1.2 Protocol Support ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
- [‚úÖ] Complete implementation of all common DNS record types (A, AAAA, CNAME, MX, TXT, SOA, NS)
- [üöß] Add support for EDNS0 (Extended DNS) - *Partial (OPT record parsing)*
- [‚úÖ] Implement DNS compression pointer handling
- [‚è∏Ô∏è] Add TCP support (required for large responses) - *Deferred to Phase 2*
- [‚úÖ] Implement proper TTL handling
- [‚úÖ] **NEW**: Implement iterative DNS resolution for dig +trace support

### 1.3 Testing & Reliability ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
- [‚úÖ] Unit tests for all DNS packet components
- [‚úÖ] Integration tests with real DNS queries
- [‚úÖ] Logging system with configurable levels (tracing)
- [‚úÖ] Real-world testing with dig command
- [‚úÖ] **NEW**: Support for iterative queries (RD=0)
- [üìù] **NOTE**: dig +trace has a known limitation with non-standard ports (our port 1053)
- [‚è∏Ô∏è] Stress testing framework - *Deferred to Phase 2*
- [‚è∏Ô∏è] Metrics collection (query count, response times, errors) - *Deferred to Phase 2*

**MILESTONE ACHIEVED**: Basic DNS server is fully functional and successfully resolves all common record types!
**NEW FEATURE**: Added iterative query support for tools like dig +trace

## Implementation Strategy

### Priority Order
1. **Phase 1** - Without basic DNS functionality, nothing else matters
2. **Phase 2** - Performance is critical for a DNS server
3. **Phase 3** - Core differentiating feature (adblocking)
4. **Phase 4** - Essential for home lab use cases
5. **Phase 5** - Required for production deployment
6. **Phase 6** - Nice-to-have advanced features

### Technology Choices
- **Async Runtime**: Continue with Tokio for high concurrency
- **Web Framework**: Consider Axum or Actix for API/Web UI
- **Cache Storage**: In-memory with optional Redis backend
- **Configuration**: TOML for human-friendly config files
- **Metrics**: prometheus-rust for metrics export
- **Logging**: tracing crate for structured logging

### Performance Targets
- < 1ms average resolution time for cached queries
- < 50ms for upstream queries
- Support for 10,000+ queries per second on modest hardware
- Memory usage < 100MB for 1 million cached entries
- Blocklist loading < 5 seconds for 1 million domains

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for all components
- Integration tests with real DNS infrastructure
- Benchmark suite for performance tracking
- Chaos testing for reliability
- Security audit before v1.0 release
