# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Heimdall is a fully functional DNS server implementation in Rust that supports both UDP and TCP protocols on port 1053. Features complete DNS resolution logic, intelligent caching, and robust compression pointer handling.

## Common Development Commands

### Build and Run
```bash
# Build the project
cargo build

# Run the DNS server (listens on port 1053)
cargo run

# Build in release mode
cargo build --release

# Run tests
cargo test

# Run with verbose output
RUST_LOG=debug cargo run
```

### Testing the DNS Server
```bash
# Start the server in background (with logging to heimdall.log)
./start_server.sh

# Stop the server
./stop_server.sh

# Test with a single DNS query
dig google.com @127.0.0.1 -p 1053

# Test iterative queries (use +norecurse instead of +trace due to port limitation)
dig google.com @127.0.0.1 -p 1053 +norecurse

# dig +trace now works with Heimdall (root zone query fix implemented)
dig google.com @127.0.0.1 -p 1053 +trace

# Test modern record types
dig cloudflare.com HTTPS @127.0.0.1 -p 1053  # HTTPS/SVCB records
dig example.com LOC @127.0.0.1 -p 1053       # Location records
dig example.com NAPTR @127.0.0.1 -p 1053     # Naming Authority Pointer
dig example.com SPF @127.0.0.1 -p 1053       # SPF records (usually TXT)

# Use the provided watch script for continuous testing
./watch.sh

# View server logs
tail -f heimdall.log
```

### Development Workflow
```bash
# Format code
cargo fmt

# Check for linting issues
cargo clippy

# Check if project compiles without building
cargo check

# Run a specific test
cargo test test_name

# Run performance regression tests
./scripts/check_performance.sh

# Create new performance baseline
./scripts/check_performance.sh --create-baseline

# Test configurable runtime (2 worker threads, 5 max concurrent queries)
HEIMDALL_WORKER_THREADS=2 HEIMDALL_MAX_CONCURRENT_QUERIES=5 cargo run

# Test cache persistence (saves cache to disk every 60 seconds, rkyv format)
HEIMDALL_CACHE_FILE_PATH="./heimdall_cache.rkyv" HEIMDALL_CACHE_SAVE_INTERVAL=60 cargo run

# Test with rate limiting enabled
HEIMDALL_ENABLE_RATE_LIMITING=true HEIMDALL_QUERIES_PER_SECOND_PER_IP=10 cargo run
```

## Architecture Overview

The codebase implements a production-ready DNS server with both UDP and TCP support:

### Core Structure
- **main.rs**: Concurrent UDP/TCP server loops using Tokio, binds to 127.0.0.1:1053
- **resolver.rs**: Full DNS resolution logic with upstream forwarding and caching integration
- **cache.rs**: Thread-safe DNS cache with TTL awareness and LRU eviction
- **config.rs**: Configuration management with environment variable support
- **dns/mod.rs**: Main DNSPacket structure with complete parsing and serialization
- **dns/header.rs**: DNS header with all standard fields and flags
- **dns/question.rs**: Question section with compression pointer support
- **dns/resource.rs**: Resource records with rdata parsing and reconstruction
- **dns/enums.rs**: Complete DNS record types (A, AAAA, CNAME, MX, TXT, etc.)
- **dns/common.rs**: Shared parsing utilities with compression pointer handling

### Current Features âœ…
- **Complete DNS Resolution**: Forward queries to upstream servers (8.8.8.8, 1.1.1.1)
- **Dual Protocol Support**: Concurrent UDP and TCP listeners with automatic fallback
- **Intelligent Caching**: Thread-safe cache with TTL respect and zero-copy rkyv persistence
- **Compression Handling**: Full DNS compression pointer parsing and reconstruction
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: RFC-compliant REFUSED, NOTIMPL, FORMERR, and SERVFAIL responses
- **High Performance**: Sub-millisecond cached responses, zero-copy optimizations
- **Advanced Performance Features**: Query deduplication, connection pooling, parallel queries
- **Security & Validation**: Input validation, rate limiting (per-IP & global), attack detection
- **Health Monitoring**: Automatic failover with exponential backoff and health tracking
- **Configurable Runtime**: Custom Tokio thread pool with concurrency limiting
- **Regression Testing**: Automated performance benchmarking and regression detection
- **Protocol Compliance**: Proper DNS packet validation, opcode handling, and response generation
- **RFC 2308 Compliance**: Complete negative caching with SOA-based TTL handling
- **Modern Record Types**: Full parsing support for HTTPS/SVCB, LOC, NAPTR, DNAME, and SPF records
- **Distributed Systems**: Redis L2 cache, cluster coordination, aggregated metrics

### Packet Flow
1. **Receive**: UDP/TCP socket receives DNS query
2. **Parse**: Complete packet parsing with compression pointer support
3. **Validate**: Check opcode, validate query structure, apply security policies
4. **Error Check**: Return REFUSED/NOTIMPL/FORMERR for invalid queries
5. **Cache Check**: Check cache for existing valid responses (including negative cache)
6. **Resolve**: Forward to upstream servers if cache miss
7. **TCP Fallback**: Automatic TCP retry if UDP response truncated
8. **Parse Response**: Full response parsing with rdata reconstruction
9. **Cache Store**: Store response in cache with TTL awareness
10. **Send**: Return properly formatted response to client

### Key Implementation Details
- Uses `bitstream-io` for bit-level DNS packet manipulation
- Thread-safe caching with `DashMap` for concurrent access
- Proper DNS compression pointer parsing in both directions
- TCP length-prefixed message handling per RFC standards
- Configurable upstream servers and timeout settings
- Comprehensive logging with `tracing` crate
