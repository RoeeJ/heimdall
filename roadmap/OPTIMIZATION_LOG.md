# Heimdall DNS Server Optimization Log

## Overview
This document tracks the performance optimization journey of Heimdall DNS server, documenting each phase, the techniques applied, and the results achieved.

## Baseline Performance
- **Date**: 2024-12-14
- **Baseline QPS**: 20,553
- **P99 Latency**: 8.6ms
- **Test Configuration**: 100 clients, extreme load scenario

## Phase 1: Zero-Copy Parsing & Thread-Local Buffers

### Date: 2024-12-14

### Optimizations Applied:
1. **Zero-Copy DNS Packet Parsing**
   - Implemented `DNSPacketView` for parsing without allocations
   - Direct byte slice operations instead of copying data
   - Lazy parsing of packet sections

2. **Thread-Local Buffer Pools**
   - Eliminated contention on global buffer allocator
   - Pre-allocated 4KB buffers per thread
   - Buffer reuse within thread context

3. **Optimized String Handling**
   - String interning for common domain names
   - Reduced allocations in hot paths

### Results:
- **Peak QPS**: 25,429 (+23.7%)
- **P99 Latency**: 2.1ms (-75.6%)
- **Memory Allocations**: Reduced by ~60%

### Key Learnings:
- Memory allocation was the primary bottleneck
- Thread-local storage significantly reduces contention
- Zero-copy parsing is essential for high-performance networking

## Phase 2: Lock-Free Cache & Cache Line Optimization

### Date: 2024-12-15

### Optimizations Applied:
1. **Lock-Free Cache Implementation**
   - Replaced mutex-based cache with lock-free `DashMap`
   - Implemented `OptimizedDnsCache` with hot cache layer
   - Zero contention on concurrent cache operations

2. **Hot Cache Layer**
   - 10% of cache capacity for frequently accessed items
   - Automatic promotion after 3 accesses
   - Reduces lookup time for popular domains

3. **Cache Line Optimization**
   - 64-byte aligned structures for hot data
   - Separated hot (metadata) and cold (DNS response) data
   - Improved CPU cache utilization

4. **SLRU Eviction Policy**
   - Segmented LRU with probationary (20%) and protected (80%) segments
   - Reduces cache pollution from one-time accesses
   - Better hit rates for frequently accessed domains

5. **Access Pattern Tracking**
   - Lock-free access counting
   - Efficient promotion decisions
   - Minimal overhead

### Results:
- **Peak QPS**: 65,179.5 (+156.4% from Phase 1, +217% from baseline)
- **P99 Latency**: 1.60ms (-23.8% from Phase 1)
- **P99.9 Latency**: 2.20ms
- **Zero packet loss** under extreme load

### Key Learnings:
- Lock-free data structures are crucial for high concurrency
- Cache line alignment significantly impacts performance
- Hot/cold data separation reduces memory bandwidth usage
- SLRU eviction maintains better hit rates than simple LRU

## Performance Progression Summary

| Phase | QPS | Improvement | P99 Latency | Key Technique |
|-------|-----|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| Baseline | 20,553 | - | 8.6ms | - |
