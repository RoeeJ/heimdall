# Heimdall DNS Server Roadmap

## Current Status: Phase 9 - Distributed Systems & High Availability! üéØüåê‚ú®

**‚úÖ ENTERPRISE-READY DISTRIBUTED DNS SERVER**: Heimdall is now a production-grade clustered DNS solution!
- Successfully resolves all common DNS record types (A, AAAA, MX, NS, CNAME, TXT, SOA)
- Dual protocol support (UDP + TCP) with automatic fallback
- Intelligent caching with sub-millisecond response times and zero-copy persistence
- Complete DNS compression pointer handling
- Full EDNS0 support with buffer size negotiation and extension parsing
- Configurable upstream servers with comprehensive error handling
- **Security & Validation**: Input validation, rate limiting, DoS protection
- **Advanced Reliability**: Health monitoring, automatic failover, connection pooling
- **Performance Features**: Query deduplication, parallel queries, zero-copy optimizations
- **RFC Compliance**: Enhanced error handling (REFUSED, NOTIMPL, FORMERR), negative caching, UDP truncation
- **Distributed Features**: Redis-based L2 cache, cluster member discovery, aggregated metrics
- **Kubernetes Native**: Auto-deployment with Keel (force policy), Helm charts, headless services, pod coordination
- **Production Metrics**: Fixed histogram recording for accurate response time distribution
- Production-ready for enterprise DNS forwarding with clustering and high availability

**Recent Achievements**: 
- ‚úÖ **Modern DNS Record Types**: Added parsing for HTTPS/SVCB, LOC, NAPTR, DNAME, and SPF records
- ‚úÖ **UDP Truncation Support**: Full RFC 1035 compliance with TC flag and automatic TCP retry
- ‚úÖ **Redis L2 Cache**: Distributed caching across replicas with automatic failover
- ‚úÖ **Cluster Coordination**: Redis-based member registry with health tracking
- ‚úÖ **Aggregated Metrics**: Cluster-wide Prometheus metrics and analytics
- ‚úÖ **Kubernetes Integration**: Auto-deployment with Keel (force policy), headless services, pod coordination
- ‚úÖ **Malformed Packet Handling**: Graceful error handling with proper logging
- ‚úÖ **Metrics Fix**: Corrected histogram recording to use individual response times
- ‚úÖ **Negative Caching**: Complete RFC 2308 implementation with SOA-based TTL

**Usage**: 
- `./start_server.sh` - Start server in background with logging
- `./stop_server.sh` - Stop the server
- `dig @127.0.0.1 -p 1053 google.com A` - Test UDP
- `dig @127.0.0.1 -p 1053 google.com MX +tcp` - Test TCP
- `helm install heimdall ./helm/heimdall` - Deploy to Kubernetes
- `curl http://heimdall:8080/cluster/stats` - View cluster statistics

## Vision
Transform Heimdall into a high-performance, adblocking DNS server with custom domain management capabilities, suitable for home labs and small networks.
