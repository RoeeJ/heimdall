# Heimdall DNS Server Optimization Guide

## Overview

This guide consolidates the performance optimization strategy, implementation details, and results achieved for the Heimdall DNS server. Through systematic optimization phases, we've improved performance from a baseline of 20,553 QPS to 65,179.5 QPS (+217%), while reducing P99 latency from 8.6ms to 1.60ms (-81%).

## Performance Goals and Achievements

### Initial Baseline
- **Baseline QPS**: 20,553
- **P99 Latency**: 8.6ms
- **Architecture**: Tokio async runtime, DashMap cache, standard UDP sockets

### Current Performance (After Phase 2)
- **Peak QPS**: 65,179.5 (+217% from baseline)
- **P99 Latency**: 1.60ms (-81% from baseline)
- **P99.9 Latency**: 2.20ms
- **Zero packet loss** under extreme load

### Target Goals
- **Short Term**: ✅ 30,000 QPS (Achieved: 65,179.5 QPS)
- **Medium Term**: ✅ 40,000 QPS (Exceeded)
- **Long Term**: ✅ 60,000+ QPS (Exceeded)
- **Next Target**: 80,000-100,000+ QPS with advanced optimizations

## Completed Optimizations

### Phase 1: Zero-Copy Parsing & Thread-Local Buffers ✅

#### Implementations
1. **Zero-Copy DNS Packet Parsing**
   - Implemented `DNSPacketView` for parsing without allocations
   - Direct byte slice operations instead of copying data
   - Lazy parsing of packet sections
   - String interning for common domain names

2. **Thread-Local Buffer Pools**
   - Eliminated contention on global buffer allocator
   - Pre-allocated 4KB buffers per thread
   - Buffer reuse within thread context

#### Results
- **Peak QPS**: 25,429 (+23.7%)
- **P99 Latency**: 2.1ms (-75.6%)
- **Memory Allocations**: Reduced by ~60%

### Phase 2: Lock-Free Cache & Cache Line Optimization ✅

#### Implementations
1. **Lock-Free Cache**
   - Replaced mutex-based cache with lock-free `DashMap`
   - Implemented `OptimizedDnsCache` with hot cache layer
   - Zero contention on concurrent cache operations

2. **Hot Cache Layer**
   - 10% of cache capacity for frequently accessed items
   - Automatic promotion after 3 accesses
   - Reduces lookup time for popular domains

3. **Cache Line Optimization**
   - 64-byte aligned structures for hot data
   - Separated hot (metadata) and cold (DNS response) data
   - Improved CPU cache utilization

4. **SLRU Eviction Policy**
   - Segmented LRU with probationary (20%) and protected (80%) segments
   - Reduces cache pollution from one-time accesses
   - Better hit rates for frequently accessed domains

#### Results
- **Peak QPS**: 65,179.5 (+156.4% from Phase 1)
- **P99 Latency**: 1.60ms (-23.8% from Phase 1)
- **Cache Hit Rate**: Improved by ~15%

## Remaining Optimization Opportunities

### Phase 3: Network Stack Optimization (Planned)
**Expected Gain: 20-25% (Target: 80,000+ QPS)**

#### 3.1 Multiple UDP Sockets with SO_REUSEPORT
```rust
// Enable kernel-level load balancing across sockets
fn create_reuse_port_socket() -> Result<UdpSocket> {
    let socket = std::net::UdpSocket::bind("0.0.0.0:0")?;
    setsockopt(socket.as_raw_fd(), ReusePort, &true)?;
    socket.bind("127.0.0.1:1053")?;
    Ok(UdpSocket::from_std(socket)?)
}
```

#### 3.2 Batch Processing with recvmmsg/sendmmsg
- Process up to 32 packets per syscall
- Reduce context switches
- Improve throughput under high load

#### 3.3 io_uring Implementation (Linux)
- Zero-copy packet processing
- Reduced syscall overhead
- Async I/O without thread pool overhead

### Phase 4: SIMD Optimizations (Planned)
**Expected Gain: 15-20% (Target: 95,000+ QPS)**

#### 4.1 Domain Name Comparison with AVX2
- Vectorized case-insensitive comparison
- Process 32 bytes at a time
- Hardware-accelerated string operations

#### 4.2 Parallel CRC/Checksum Calculations
- SIMD-accelerated checksum validation
- Batch validation of multiple packets

### Phase 5: Advanced Optimizations (Future)
**Target: 100,000+ QPS**

#### 5.1 CPU Affinity and NUMA Awareness
- Pin worker threads to specific cores
- NUMA-aware memory allocation
- Minimize cross-core communication

#### 5.2 Custom Memory Allocator
- jemalloc or mimalloc integration
- Arena allocator for DNS packets
- Reduced allocation overhead

#### 5.3 Kernel Bypass (DPDK/XDP)
- Direct NIC access
- Zero kernel involvement
- Requires dedicated hardware

## Implementation Guidelines

### 1. Feature Flags for Safe Rollout
```rust
pub struct OptimizationFlags {
    pub zero_copy_parsing: bool,      // Low risk, enabled by default
    pub thread_local_buffers: bool,   // Low risk, enabled by default
    pub lock_free_cache: bool,        // Medium risk, test first
    pub simd_enabled: bool,           // Auto-detect CPU support
    pub io_uring_enabled: bool,       // High risk, opt-in
}
```

### 2. Performance Testing Framework
```rust
// Automated benchmarks with criterion
#[cfg(test)]
mod perf_tests {
    use criterion::{black_box, criterion_group, criterion_main, Criterion};
    
    fn benchmark_packet_parsing(c: &mut Criterion) {
        c.bench_function("parse_packet", |b| {
            b.iter(|| DNSPacket::parse(black_box(&packet_data)))
        });
    }
}
```

### 3. Continuous Performance Monitoring
- Run benchmarks on every commit
- Track performance regressions automatically
- Compare against baseline metrics

### 4. Gradual Rollout Strategy
1. **Dev Testing**: Enable all optimizations
2. **Staging**: Enable low-risk optimizations only
3. **Production**: Gradual rollout with monitoring
4. **Full Deploy**: All stable optimizations enabled

## Key Learnings

1. **Memory allocation is the primary bottleneck** - Zero-copy and buffer reuse provide immediate gains
2. **Lock-free data structures are crucial** for high concurrency scenarios
3. **Cache line alignment matters** - Proper data layout can significantly impact performance
4. **Hot/cold data separation** reduces memory bandwidth usage
5. **SLRU eviction** maintains better hit rates than simple LRU for DNS workloads

## Monitoring Checklist

Before declaring an optimization successful:
- [ ] QPS throughput maintained or improved
- [ ] P99 latency within acceptable range
- [ ] No increase in error rates
- [ ] Memory usage stable
- [ ] CPU usage per query reduced
- [ ] No crashes or panics
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Performance regression tests pass
