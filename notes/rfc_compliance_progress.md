# RFC Compliance Implementation Progress

## Session Summary - January 2025

### Completed Work

#### 1. RDATA Parsing Implementation (17 types complete)
- **Basic types**: A, AAAA, MX, NS, CNAME, PTR, TXT (7 types)
- **Critical types**: SOA, SRV, CAA (3 types)
- **DNSSEC types**: DNSKEY, RRSIG, DS, NSEC, NSEC3 (5 types)
- **Security types**: TLSA, SSHFP (2 types)

All implemented types include:
- Full wire format parsing with compression pointer support
- Helper methods for field extraction
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Integration with negative caching (SOA minimum TTL)

#### 2. Complete Negative Caching (RFC 2308) ✅
**Discovered**: Implementation was already mostly complete!

**Already implemented**:
- SOA-based TTL handling using min(SOA TTL, SOA minimum field)
- NXDOMAIN response caching with statistics
- NODATA response caching (RCODE=0, no answers)
- Proper negative cache expiration with TTL management
- NSEC/NSEC3 record preservation in cached responses
- Comprehensive test coverage

**Key findings**:
- Cache properly identifies negative responses
- Uses new SOA parsing helpers for minimum TTL extraction
- Maintains all authority records including NSEC/NSEC3
- Statistics track NXDOMAIN, NODATA, and negative hits

### Current Task: Enhanced Error Handling ✅ COMPLETED

#### Completed Implementation:
1. **REFUSED responses** ✅
   - Zone transfer queries (AXFR/IXFR) are refused
   - ANY queries refused for amplification attack prevention
   - Policy-based rejection with proper metrics tracking

2. **NOTIMPL responses** ✅
   - Unsupported opcodes (UPDATE, NOTIFY, DSO, etc.) return NOTIMPL
   - Only QUERY opcode is implemented
   - Proper validation in server request handling

3. **FORMERR responses** ✅
   - Malformed packets with invalid opcodes
   - Queries with no questions (qdcount=0)
   - Invalid packet structure

4. **Opcode validation** ✅
   - Created DnsOpcode enum with all standard opcodes
   - Integrated validation into server.rs handle_dns_query
   - Invalid opcodes (7-15) properly rejected

5. **Extended RCODE support** ✅
   - Added ResponseCode enum with all RFC-defined codes
   - Support for YXDomain, YXRRSet, NXRRSet, NotAuth, NotZone
   - Proper conversion and validation methods

6. **Detailed error reporting** - Deferred (basic reporting complete)

#### Key Changes Made:
- **dns/enums.rs**: Added DnsOpcode and ResponseCode enums
- **server.rs**: 
  - Added opcode validation in handle_dns_query
  - Created should_refuse_query() for policy enforcement
  - Integrated error response generation with metrics
- **metrics.rs**: Added error_responses CounterVec for tracking
- **tests/error_handling_tests.rs**: Comprehensive test suite with 10 tests

#### Test Results:
All 10 error handling tests passing:
- Zone transfer refusal (AXFR/IXFR)
- ANY query refusal
- NOTIMPL for unsupported opcodes
- FORMERR for malformed queries
- Extended response code validation
- Normal queries still work properly

### Next Priorities

1. **Network Infrastructure Types** - Phase 3 record types (next task)
2. **DNSSEC Validation** - Cryptographic signature verification
3. **Authoritative DNS Support** - Zone management and transfers
4. **Detailed Error Reporting** - Enhanced client error messages

### Key Achievements This Session

- Expanded DNS record support from 7 to 17 parsed types
- Implemented all critical record types for production use
- Discovered and validated complete negative caching implementation
- Completed enhanced error handling with RFC-compliant responses
- Added comprehensive error response metrics and testing
- Updated all documentation to reflect current state
