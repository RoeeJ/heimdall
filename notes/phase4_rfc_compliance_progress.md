# Phase 4 RFC Compliance Progress

## Enhanced Error Handling (COMPLETED ✅)

### Implementation Summary
- Added comprehensive error response handling to Heimdall
- Implemented all standard DNS response codes (RCODEs)
- Added policy-based query rejection for security
- Full opcode validation with appropriate error responses

### Key Features Implemented:
1. **REFUSED Responses**:
   - Zone transfer queries (AXFR, IXFR) are refused
   - ANY queries are refused for security reasons
   - Policy-based rejection with proper REFUSED response code

2. **NOTIMPL Responses**:
   - Added DnsOpcode enum with all standard opcodes
   - Validation of incoming query opcodes
   - NOTIMPL response for unsupported operations (IQuery, Status, etc.)

3. **FORMERR Responses**:
   - Malformed packet detection
   - Proper FORMERR response generation
   - Enhanced validation of DNS packet structure

4. **Extended RCODEs**:
   - All RFC-defined response codes implemented
   - YXDomain, YXRRSet, NXRRSet, NotAuth, NotZone, BadOptVersion
   - Proper response generation for each error type

5. **Metrics Integration**:
   - Added error_responses metric to track error types
   - Per-protocol tracking (UDP/TCP)
   - Prometheus-compatible metrics export

### Testing:
- Comprehensive test suite with 10 tests covering all scenarios
- Tests for REFUSED, NOTIMPL, FORMERR responses
- Validation of proper error code generation
- All tests passing ✅

### Files Modified:
- `src/dns/enums.rs` - Added DnsOpcode enum and extended ResponseCode
- `src/server.rs` - Added opcode validation and policy enforcement
- `src/metrics.rs` - Added error response tracking
- `tests/error_handling_tests.rs` - Comprehensive test coverage

## Root Zone Query Fix (COMPLETED ✅)

### Bug Description:
- dig +trace was failing against Heimdall with "TYPE512/CLASS256" error
- Root zone queries (empty label list) were not being serialized correctly
- The write_labels() function didn't handle empty label lists properly

### Root Cause:
- In `src/dns/common.rs`, the write_labels() function assumed at least one label
- For root zone queries (represented by empty label list), no null terminator was written
- This caused malformed packets that dig couldn't parse

### Fix Applied:
```rust
// Handle root zone (empty labels)
if labels.is_empty() {
    writer.write_var::<u8>(8, 0)?;
    return Ok(());
}
```

### Testing:
- Created `tests/trace_query_test.rs` to validate root zone query handling
- Tested with actual dig +trace commands
- Verified fix works with both test script and real dig +trace
- All root zone queries now properly serialize and parse ✅

### Impact:
- dig +trace now works correctly with Heimdall
- Improved compatibility with standard DNS tools
- Fixed a critical edge case in DNS packet serialization

## Summary

Phase 4.1 Core RFC Compliance is now **COMPLETED**:
- ✅ Complete Negative Caching (RFC 2308)
- ✅ Enhanced Error Handling 
- ✅ Comprehensive DNS Record Type Support (85 types)
- ✅ RDATA Parsing for all critical types (17/85 implemented)
- ✅ Root Zone Query Support (dig +trace fix)

All critical RFC compliance features for a production DNS resolver are now implemented!
